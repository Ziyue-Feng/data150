Q&A 9/3/2020

1. In Hans Rosling’s “Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen”, he talks about preconceived ideas about global development and global health.
What is comparison?  What is difference between western world and 3rd world?
Describe how rosling introduced preconceived ideas and description of difference.

In his presentation, Rosling proposes the idea of “We” vs. “Them” where “We” represents the western world and “them” represent the third world.  He found that there are preconceived ideas that the western world has longer life and smaller families, while the third world has shorter life and larger families, but that is not actually always true.  Now, most of the world has small families and long lives.  There are also preconceived ideas that the western world is so much more advanced than the third world, but one cannot make such broad generalizations about such large regions.  
He introduced these ideas by sharing a question he asked his Scandinavian students to say which country has the highest child mortality.  The students got less than half of the questions right because they answered with a western bias, consistently saying that western countries were more advanced and “better off” in terms of their health care and child mortality.  As it turned out, when chimpanzees were asked the questions, they ended up getting more of them correct.  One of the main comparisons that emphasized the point Rosling was making is the fact that Vietnam has undergone significant social change, with smaller families and longer lives becoming more prevalent, so their statistics are not all that different from those of the United States, even though they are thought of as being part of the “third world.” 

2. Which comes first, wealth or health?  What was his point and what was the example he gave?  Describe health care and education, why are these endeavors important?  Are they important because they are high cost or is there another reason they are important?

Health is a precursor to wealth.  Rosing’s point was that people must be healthy in order to be successful in gaining wealth.  In the presentation he said that “health cannot be bought at the supermarket” which I take to mean that health must be something that is continuously enforced because it cannot just be given to people.  One of the main examples he gave was in China where the health of the country increased from around 1960-1980 and then the wealth of the country was able to start increasing around 1980.  The social change that was brought about in Vietnam was also emphasized and the fact that health and social change has occurred there much more than we give the country credit for.
In terms of the importance of education and health care, education enables more employment opportunities and possibilities for advancement.  You must also be healthy to be able to keep a job and pursue more opportunities.  Health care and education can, but benefits outweigh costs.  However, in the context of development, health care and education are often more labor intensive and time intensive than they are expensive.  These endeavors are important because of the amount of time and effort that must be invested in them, not always because they are the most expensive options.

Amartya Sen:
1. What is development?  Is it more expansive or a narrower view than we normally hold?  Why?
According to Amartya Sen, “Development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy.”  These freedoms can include political, economic, social, protective, and transparency freedoms.  This is a much more expansive view than people normally hold because people typically categorize development into just one area, such as economic development, in the form of GNP/GDP, technological advances, or social modernization.  With Sen’s view of development, all of these ideas are combined under the concept of increasing one’s freedoms.
These freedoms occur through the removal of barriers.  It is more important to focus on this end goal of development instead of honing in on the means of development like a thriving economy.

2. What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires to be removed? Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?
Some sources of unfreedoms include poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities, social deprivation, neglect of public facilities, and intolerance of repressive states (political unfreedom).  The American Civil War is an example of a time when a significant population of the US was experiencing unfreedom because of an unfree labor contract.
Free and sustainable agency is a major engine of development because it allows people to participate in social change and in the decision making process.  It is also a stepping stone to other kinds of development in other areas.  The values of these free agencies are not linear, but rather span multiple areas and views to create the full effect of development.  When people have free agency, they are also able to obtain development in a way that works for their area since not all solutions are universal.
In the introduction, many examples were given about how unfreedoms are not always equal.  For example, when comparing populations of countries like South Africa and Brazil with Sri Lanka, China, or Kerala in India, the former have higher GNP, yet the later tend to have longer live expectancies.  Having free agency is essential here because the solutions must be applied in very specific manners.

3. What does he say about being generically against markets and what is the importance of his description of markets and freedom of speech?
Markets do play an important role in development.  Sen claims that, “to be generically against markets would be almost as odd as being generically against conversations between people.”
Following this claim, freedom of markets is as necessary as free speech and people should be able to exchange and receive ideas.  Markets may be negative, there still must be freedom to exchange because it is a natural part of being human.  Everyone wants to be able to improve their lives and their well-being.

4. Who were Condorcet and Malthus?  And what did they argue?  Who is right?
These men were people who studied and shared views about population growth and whether it is a violation of freedom to moderate fertility rates.
Condorcet was a French rationalist who argued that fertility will end up decreasing due to “progress of reason” where people will naturally decrease the number of children that they have due to education and security.
Malthus disagreed with this argument and claimed that only a shortage of resources would decrease population growth.  According to him, it doesn’t matter the education or reason of a population; it will continue to grow as long as there are resources to do so.  There is some reason in thinking about family growth, but not always.
At this point, I cannot determine if one claim is more correct than the other.  If we were to cite Rosling, the claim would have to be that we cannot say that developing countries are continuing to grow while developed countries have a lower or negative growth rate.  However, the global human population is continuing to increase, and has been rapidly for about the past 100 years, despite increased knowledge about the risks of population growth.  When taking these two ideas into account, it is difficult to claim whether people are consciously reasoning over whether to have a larger family or if the global population will continue to grow, even as more countries develop.
