# Read Along - Data Insight 1

A recent data science development is the Google technology called Read Along.  When it was first released, the technology was called Bolo, but the name has recently been changed.  Read Along was first launched in India in the spring of 2019 and it is a free app that allows children around the age of 6-11 to practice reading, pronunciation, and reading comprehension.  Students interact with an artificial intelligence instructor named Diya and feedback is provided to the student through voice user interface technology and machine learning that react to pattern recognition within the app.  The app is now available in almost 180 countries and can be used in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, and multiple other languages (Kumar).
This voice user interface (voice UI) employs the same technologies as other Google technologies, such as Google assist with speech recognition.  This technology processes voice commands and then text-to-speech technologies aid in providing feedback to the student depending on their response as they read.  Utilizing machine learning, the program adapts to the student’s reading, either providing positive reinforcement, or offering correction to the student.  This application of data science allows the app to process what the student says and then use that data to return a response to aid in the learning process through pattern recognition and similarity matching.  The patterns of the student's speech are paired with the data within the app for each story.  If there is consistent difference between these points of data, the child will receive feedback to work towards improvement.  In the original version of the app, the text the student was reading would turn green if the student read it correctly, while turning black if the text was not read correctly.  However, developers found that this was not always conducive to learning since the student would solely attempt to make the words turn green.  The newer version of the app takes a more comprehensive approach and instead allows the student to continue on as long as they have read the majority of the sentence or passage correctly.  
The technology does have some flaws, due to the nature of false positives and false negatives when it comes to the implementation of machine learning.  The app is not always accurate and this can lead to the child becoming frustrated if they are not rewarded for reading correctly, or it leads them to feel they can cheat the system by progressing under a false positive.  However, this drawback is not significant enough to warrant any termination of use.  Also, due to the nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the constant updates to the technology quickly remedy many of the errors.
One very important aspect of this method of learning is the fact that the app can be used offline.  Not only does this capability allow for people to have access to the services regardless of connectivity, but it also acts as a security measure in terms of privacy.  Parents are required to give permission for the app to use the microphone on the device, but even then, Google does not directly collect any data from the device and there are no ads or in-app purchases.  Although the app does not allow for larger data collection, data is collected on an individual basis for each child with the app, allowing for progress to be measured, while protecting privacy.  The data collection of this app could likely be improved even more through the use of neural networking in addition to the pattern recognition methods of data collectoin.  The issue of accessibility is an important one, especially since the app was originally created to be used in India and there are many people in the country who do not have access to internet at all times.  
This advancement in education technology is essential to development.  According to researchers like Amartya Sen, development is a measure of freedoms.  The social freedom to have access to education is a crucial freedom and one that many people, especially in countries like India, are denied.  Within India, over half of the children have reading levels significantly below their grade level.  According to Read Along developers, 517,000,000 children are not functional readers around the world (Read Along).  This poses a significant problem, not just for those individuals, but to society as a whole.  Many parents in India recognize that they are often unable to help their children learn to read or provide accurate feedback and, many times, there are not enough teachers and schools available since the population is growing at such a rapid rate and so many people live in rural areas.  These concepts of inaccessibility of access to education can be applied to other areas around the world.  Especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, technologies like Read Along could be vital to the continuation of education of children around the globe when access to in-person learning is more limited and parents often have a hard time teaching their children.  If children are able to access a good education, they are more likely to gain a job that provides them with money, but they are also able to be more productive members of their society in general, participating in the economy, the political system, and promoting education for new generations of children.
